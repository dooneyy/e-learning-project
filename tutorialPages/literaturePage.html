        <p class="p m-3">
            Literature broadly is any collection of written work, but it is also used more narrowly for writings specifically considered to be an art form, especially prose fiction, drama, and poetry.[1] In recent centuries, the definition has expanded to include oral literature, much of which has been transcribed.[2] Literatue is a method of recording, preserving, and transmitting knowledge and entertainment.

            Literature, as an art form, can also include works in various non-fiction genres, such as autobiography, diaries, memoir, letters, and the essay. Within its broad definition, literature includes non-fictional books, articles or other printed information on a particular subject. [3][4]
            
            Etymologically, the term derives from Latin literatura/litteratura "learning, a writing, grammar," originally "writing formed with letters," from litera/littera "letter".[5] In spite of this, the term has also been applied to spoken or sung texts.[6][7] Developments in print technology have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, which now includes electronic literature.
            
            Literature is classified according to whether it is poetry, prose or drama, and such works are categorized according to historical periods, or their adherence to certain aesthetic features, or genre.

        <p class="p m-3">
            Poetry <br> has traditionally been distinguished from prose by its greater use of the aesthetic qualities of language, including musical devices such as assonance, aliteration, rhyme, and rhythm, and by being set in lines and verses rather than paragraphs, and more recently its use of other typographical elements.[104][105][106] This distinction is complicated by various hybrid forms such as the sound poetry, concrete poetry and prose poem,[107] and more generally by the fact that prose possesses rhythm.[108] Abram Lipsky refers to it as an "open secret" that "prose is not distinguished from poetry by lack of rhythm"

        <p class="p m-3">
            Prose <br>
As noted above, prose generally makes far less use of the aesthetic qualities of language than poetry.[105][106][113] However, developments in modern literature, including free verse and prose poetry have tended to blur the differences, and American poet T.S. Eliot suggested that while: "the distinction between verse and prose is clear, the distinction between poetry and prose is obscure".[114] There are verse novels, a type of narrative poetry in which a novel-length narrative is told through the medium of poetry rather than prose. Eugene Onegin (1831) by Alexander Pushkin is the most famous example
