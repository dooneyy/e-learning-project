            <p class="p m-3">
                What is risk management in project management? It is the process used by project managers to minimize any potential problems that may negatively impact a project's timetable. Risk is any unexpected event that might affect the people, processes, technology, and resources involved in a project. Unlike issues, which are certain to happen, risks are events that could occur, and you may not be able to tell when. Because of this uncertainty, project risk requires serious preparation in order to manage them efficiently.

            <p class="p m-3">
                People have been undertaking projects since the earliest days of organized human activity. The hunting parties of our prehistoric ancestors were projects, for example; they were temporary undertakings directed at the goal of obtaining meat for the community. Large complex projects have also been with us for a long time. The pyramids and the Great Wall of China were in their day of roughly the same dimensions as the Apollo project to send men to the moon. We use the term “project” frequently in our daily conversations. A husband, for example may tell his wife, “My main project for this weekend is to straighten out the garage.” Going hunting, building pyramids, and fixing faucets all share certain features that make them projects.

            <p class="p m-3">
                MoSCoW prioritization, also known as the MoSCoW method or MoSCoW analysis, is a popular prioritization technique for managing requirements. The method is commonly used to help key stakeholders understand the significance of initiatives in a specific release.
                The acronym, MoSCoW, stands for 4 different categories of initiatives: must-haves, should-haves, could-haves, and will not have at this time. Sometimes, the “W” in MoSCoW is used to stand for “wish” instead of “will not have right now.”
                During his tenure at Oracle, software development expert, Dai Clegg, created the MoSCoW method. The technique was later donated to the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM). Clegg initially designed MoSCoW as a prioritization framework for time-boxed projects. Specifically, for initiatives within releases. However, MoSCoW’s uses today are broader, as the method has been adapted by various practitioners. A detailed account of how to use MoSCoW prioritization in its original context is outlined in the DSDM handbook.
